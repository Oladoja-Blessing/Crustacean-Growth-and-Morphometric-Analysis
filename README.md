# Crustacean Growth and Morphometric Analysis

This repository contains data and analyses on crustacean growth and morphometric relationships, collected across different months and sampling sites. The study includes weight, length, breadth, height, chelae measurements, condition factor (K), and lengthâ€“weight relationships.
